NumberMazeSolver is a java program that uses BFS to find the shortest path through input number mazes. Mazes are .txt files that contain a number of rows and columns in line one, followed by one number per line that represents the number of moves that can be made from that spot in the constructed maze. For example, the maze input file could look like the following:

2
1
2
3
4

This would result in a number maze that looks like:

 [1, 2]
 [3, 4]

Compile: javac NumberMaze.java
Execute: java NumberMaze maze.txt
